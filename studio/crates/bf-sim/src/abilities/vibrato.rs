//! Ability kind `vibrato` (CELLO's VIBRATO): `fight.py` `trigger` 2955 to 2957.
//!
//! A stub until CELLO's port. [`start`] is already called from `trigger`'s dispatch (`abilities/mod.rs`), and every
//! other function here where `Fight.run()` calls its Python namesake, behind a test that is false until the roster
//! reads the kind (`roster::abilities::vibrato::PORTED`). So a stub body is never reached in a fight; with
//! `Fight::trace_sockets` on, one that is reached logs its name. The port fills the bodies with the Python (every draw
//! from the fight's generator in Python's order and number) and touches no other engine file. A copied ability
//! (IDENTITY CRISIS) runs this code for the copier's ball, so nothing here may assume which side has the kind.

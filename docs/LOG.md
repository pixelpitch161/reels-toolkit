## 100 Metronomes (`projects/100_metronomes`)
- Coupled-metronome sync (Kuramoto mean-field), a board on rollers, a holdout that finally locks in.
- Ticks drive the beat. The user's brief: not exactly Bit Wonder, subtle low-poly, engaging throughout.
- Fix: draw HUD text after shapes (it was being covered).

## Sand That Draws Sound (`projects/sand_draws_sound`)
- Chladni plate in a Moroccan desert ruin, from night to sunrise. Resonance sweep (12 patterns),
  slow-motion explanation, and Grieg's *Morning Mood* played as plate patterns.
- v2 (`render2.py`):
  - per-pixel floor lighting with moon, sun and fire shadows, AABB occlusion, sand shadowed per grain;
  - zellige floor, bunting, bulbs, lanterns, props, camels;
  - locked DOF, sun god rays, bloom that excludes the sand.
- Feedback: the sand rattle was too loud, so it was cut by about 24 dB.

## Crickets Are Thermometers (`projects/crickets_open`, `projects/crickets_diorama`)
- Dolbear's law: chirps in 15 s + 40 = °F, so BPM = 4(T − 40). Each chirp is the hi-hat. Seven genre
  bands as the night warms, then a cold front tape-stops the song.
- Open-environment version first. Then a Bit Wonder–like 2.5D diorama with a near-static camera.
- Lighting iterations:
  - the user asked for stronger shadows, then for a moody, dark relight;
  - that read as too dark, so the final version is the brighter middle ground (`drender.py`);
  - the moon in frame is the key light, there are long shadows from poplars, god rays and bokeh;
  - the focus is locked on the cricket and the thermometer, because a rack focus read as an error.
- Chirps sit 10–21 dB above the music in the 2.2–3.8 kHz band.
